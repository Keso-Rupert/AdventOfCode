# Learnings from AoC 2024

## Day 3
### Regex
- Looking specifically for the pattern "mul(number,number)" can be done quite easily with regex I assume. Good opportunity to learn and practise more with regex.

## Day 5
### Comparator
- Good opportunity to use the Comparator interface and try to implement a custom sorting method.

## Day 6
### Direction enum
- After recently doing 2016 day 1, where I implemented direction with a numeric value and a bunch of if statements, day 6 here allows me to redo it, using an Enum and a modulo operator to determine the direction in a nicer way.
- Also, a good day to brush up on and use recursion to step through the area until we have left it.
